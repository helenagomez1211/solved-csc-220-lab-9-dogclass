Design  and  implement  a  class  called  Dog   that  contains  Instance  data  That  Represents  the  dog’s    name    and  Define  the Dog  constructor  to accept  and  <strong>initialize</strong>  instance  data. Include  getter and setter   methods   for  the  name and  age. The  getter names   MUST  be  “getName” and  “getAge”.          The       setter                 names             must     be         “setName”       and     “setAge”.          Include          a            method             to          compute           and       return            the        age       of          the        dog       in          “person          years”                (seven                times    the        dog’s    age).     Include          a            toString        method             that      returns          a            one-­line           description      of          the        dog.      Create            a            driver                 class     called                 Kennel,          whose                main    method             instantiates     and       updates         several               Dog      objects.

<strong>Die Class    </strong>

<ul>

 <li>Using the        Die       class     defined             in          slides    pdf,      design                and       implement       a          class     called                 PairOfDice,    composed        of          two                 Die       objects.             Include              methods           to      set        and       get        the        individual         die        values,          a            method             to          roll        the        dice,     and       a          method             that      returns              the        current              sum                of          the        two       die        values.               Create          a            driver                 class     called                 RollingDice2          to          instantiate       and       use       a            PairOfDice     object.           The       driver                 should               call       <em>each     method</em>          of          the        PairOfDice     object.</li>
